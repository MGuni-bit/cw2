  <p>[Cut to Titan, where THANOS arrives through a portal, finding only fresh debris from Ebony Maw's ship.]</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Strange: [Sitting on what may have been plaza steps once] Oh, yeah, you're much more of a "THANOS."</p>

<p>THANOS: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.</p>

<p>THANOS: And where do you think he brought you? [Star-Lord crouches behind wreckage with his weapon ready, behind THANOS and to his left; Spider-Man peeks from above and behind Doctor Strange.]</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Strange: Let me guess. Your home?</p>

<p>THANOS: [Smiling reminiscently] It was. And it was beautiful. [THANOS curls his gauntleted fist and activates the Reality Stone to show Strange Titan before it was destroyed --
  green lawns, intact buildings, water-filled ponds, strolling citizens, the jack-like structures hovering and connected to the ground-based buildings with beams of energy.]
  Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Strange: Genocide.</p>

<p>THANOS: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass.
  [He relaxes his fist; the Stone stops glowing and the illusion fades back into the true state of Titan.]</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Strange: [Sarcastically] Congratulations. You're a prophet.</p>

<p>THANOS: I'm a survivor.</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Strange: Who wants to murder trillions.</p>

<p>THANOS: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, like this (snaps fingers), and they would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy.</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Strange: [Stands] And then what?</p>

<p>THANOS: I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Strange: [ entering a fighting pose] I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours.</p>

<p>THANOS: Ours? [He looks up to see a chunk of wreckage descending rapidly on him, too rapidly to react -- and powered by Iron Man. He is subsequently crushed by it.]</p>

<p> This video will be addressing the positive and negative aspects of social media and how
it affects its users and today's society.</p>

<p>This video will be split into four parts:</p>

<p>What is social media?</p>
<p>Negatives of Social Media</p>
<p>Positives of Social Media</p>
<p>Conclusion?</p>

<p>Each point will be discussed using journals, articles, statistics and other relevant sources.</p>

<p>So, what is social media?</p>

<p>Social media employ mobile and web-based technologies to create highly interactive platforms via which individuals and communities share, co-create,
discuss, and modify user-generated content. (Kietzmann et al., 2011).</p>

<p>Famous Examples include Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and one that gained a lot of traction during Lockdown, TikTok.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, the number of social media users has dramatically risen.</p>

<p>Social Media statistics from Datereportal state that in January 2021, the total number of active social media users was 4.2 billion and that is an
increase of 13.2% from January 2020. That is equal to 53% of the world's population (Kemp, 2021).</p>

<p>Social Media is so integrated into society that it is barely noticeable. For instance, people would instead go on Twitter to check the latest news rather than turning on the TV.</p>

<p>What are the drawbacks of social media?</p>

<p>One major problem with social networks is that it is tough to regulate one platform, never mind all of them.</p>

<p>A report by the Forum of Information and Democracy lists some recommendations on how social media platforms can be regulated.
One of the main recommendations is the concept of a statutory building code that outlines necessary security and quality requirements
for social media platforms to follow (Forum on Information & Democracy, 2020).</p>

<p>Other significant recommendations include;</p>

<p>requiring social networks to show in the news feed why content has been suggested to a user. (Forum on Information & Democracy, 2020)
and limiting the use of micro-targeting advertising messages. (Forum on Information & Democracy, 2020)</p>


<p>However, digital platforms have software that can detect specific keywords on posts being published and delete posts or even suspend accounts.
But there are millions of posts being published each day (Bagadiya, n.d.), so it can take time before a post is removed, and by the time a post is deleted,
a large number of users could have already been exposed to the post. This is especially damaging to younger users who could be exposed to porn and gore,
which can lead to porn addiction or other mental health problems in future life (de Alarcón et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Some posts slip through the cracks by using symbols in place for letters in certain words.</p>

<p>Another predicament of social media is how it impacts the mental health of its users.</p>

<p>The American Academy of medicine has warned about the possibility of harmful social media outcomes in teenage children and adolescents, including cyber-bullying and anxiety.
But these same risks may remain true even for adults across generations. Here are two points that show that Social media isn't really good for psychological well-being,
and in some ways, it may be harmful.</p>

<p>Social Media is addictive.</p>

<p>The applications are designed to keep the user on the app for as long as possible by showing them similar posts that they previously engaged with (e.g. liked or commented).
This can keep a user on a platform for hours without them noticing it (Siddiqui and Singh, 2016, p.74). The average user spends around 2 hours and 25 minutes on social media (Kemp, 2021).</p>
</p>

<p>Social Media is a False reality.</p>

<p>On social media, many influencers post daily about their life and most of the posts are going to be about how great their life is. This can give the viewer anxiety and self-doubt
and even make them jealous, as they are going to compare their own lives to theirs subconsciously (Monica, 2010). This is a significant problem as they only see the positive
part of their life when most likely influencers have their struggles that they don't publish.</p>

<p>Other negatives include:</p>

<p>Cyber bullying, Self absorption and a negative Body Image</p>


<p>So what are the positives of social media?</p>

<p>One obvious and big advantage of social media is connectivity and communications.</p>

<p>Over half of the world's population is on social media, making it easy to connect and collaborate with people and communities,
stay in touch with friends and family and share ideas with other users. Users can communicate with each other from anywhere globally as
long as they have an internet connection, which was very important during the lockdown as people were locked into their homes and unable to see their loved ones.

The reach a user can have is enormous and nearly limitless. Important issues can be brought to light (Siddiqui and Singh, 2016, p.73).
For example, in May of 2020, a black man named George Floyd was killed by a police officer, and the incident was recorded by bystanders and uploaded to social networks such as Reddit and Twitter.
This video quickly spread through the internet and sparked worldwide protests.</p>


<p>Another positive of social media is that it provides unlimited, free and accessible information and tutorials, most of them user-generated.

<p>There is a tutorial for nearly everything on youtube, and a quick google search will most likely provide an answer or a solution.
  There are even short 1 to 2 minute tutorials on Instagram and TikTok.</p>

<p>Social Media also allows anyone to open an online business. When social media is used correctly in conjunction with an online business, it can increase the customer base and revenue.
With social media, a business can directly interact with its customers or other businesses to form bonds or partnerships (Jussila, Kärkkäinen and Aramo-Immonen, 2014).
During Lockdown in the UK, more than 85 thousand new online businesses were launched (Basul, 2020).</p>


<p>Other positives include: Inspiration, Learning new skills, and improve brand loyalty for businesses</p>

<p>To conclude, social media has changed the way civilisation interacts with each other, messages can be sent almost instantly to someone on the other side of the globe, whether it's friends, family or someone else. It gives the user the freedom to express themselves and seek their own information. Although the drawbacks of social media should not be overlooked, when used in moderation, social media is one of the best inventions in recent times
